# Support for Binder Examples

Thanks for checking out the Binder Examples repositories! These are
example repositories that you can use for inspiration in creating
your own Binder-ready repositories.

## If you have a question of found a bug

Most of these repositories are not actively monitored, so we recommend
asking for help in one of these locations:

* If your Binder repository isn't working or you have a suggestion, **open a thread in the [Binder help forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/binder/help)**.
* If you've found a specific bug in one of these repositories, **open an issue [on the Binder docs repository](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binder/issues)**.

Thanks!
